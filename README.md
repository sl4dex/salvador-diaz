# Portfolio Website
Hi!
Welcome to my portfolio web application, it is built with the MERN stack architecture (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and bundled using Webpack.
This project showcases most of the fun things I learned in the Fullstack Open 2022 course, which you can see here.

# File structure
We separate our backend (server) and frontend (client) in two different folders, each one with its own node_modules.

## backend
index.js -> entry point of the backend
- routes -> API endpoints
- models -> MongoDB database schema
-

## frontend
- build -> bundled frontend with webpack
- src -> React frontend

# Packages / Dependencies
